# Shellac

<p class="description">`Shellac` is a pared down version of `Varnish` that lets you make a polished, AI2 branded website with HTML and CSS alone.</p>

You should use Shellac for building simple, static sites. If your application is likely to be complex and include a lot of interactivity, use Varnish proper instead.

## Usage

Add this **[CSS file](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@allenai/varnish2@latest/shellac.css)** to your html page.

## What you get

All Varnish2/MUI styles expressed as CSS Variables.

{{"demo": "Default.js", "bg": true, "defaultCodeOpen": false}}
