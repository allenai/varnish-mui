# Shellac

<p class="description">`Shellac` is a pared down version of `Varnish` that lets you make a polished, AI2 branded website with HTML alone.</p>

You should use Shellac for building simple, static sites. If your application is likely to be complex and include a lot of interactivity, use Varnish proper instead.

## Usage

Add this [css](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@allenai/varnish2@latest/shellac.css) to your html page.
